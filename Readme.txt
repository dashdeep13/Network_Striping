Network Striping:

The goal is to understand the techniques for transparent aggregation of multiple, functionally similar resources to obtain higher performance. For achieving this high performance, we have tried to optimize the single datapath between an application running on host to the network. We have designed a system which works under the TCP protocol. Striping at the TCP layer involves striping the IP packets generated by the TCP layer. Our designed system provides the source code of using two different Network Interface cards having different physical/ MAC addresses. We have designed the system to send IP packets parallely on two different data paths instead of sending the packets sequentially on one path. The IP packets for 2 paths can be differentiated based on their sequence numbers as - odd sequence number packets travel in one path and on the same path always and the even sequence number packets travel in another path. Thus the packets can be received from 2 paths and combined at the receiver. The IP packets using TCP communication protocol are received in the order in which they are sent since its a reliable message delivery system. The parallel communication gives better performance in terms of bandwidth, latency, buffering and scalability. 

We have studied the different methods of Network Striping and implemented IP packet striping at the TCP layer.
